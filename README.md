# Taskr

## Overview
Taskr is a single-page web application built with React that helps users efficiently manage their tasks. Tasks are color-coded and sorted based on priority by due date and estimated completion time. Users can filter, sort, search, and toggle completed tasks, while receiving immediate positive feedback through a completion percentage tracker. A statistics page provides a bar chart overview of tasks based on priority levels.

## Features
- **Task Management:** Add, check off, and remove tasks easily.
- **Filtering:** Filter tasks by priority (Red, Yellow, Green, Overdue) or completion status.
- **Sorting:** Sort tasks by due date, alphabetically, reverse-alphabetically, or by priority color.
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly find tasks by name.
- **Toggle Completed Tasks:** Show or hide completed tasks at any time.
- **Real-time Feedback:** A completion percentage tracker keeps users motivated.
- **Bar Chart Visualization:** View an overview of tasks based on priority distribution.
- **React Router Navigation:** Easily switch between sections of the app.
- **Material UI Components:** A clean, user-friendly interface with accessible UI components.

## Technologies Used
- **React** (State management, component structure)
- **React Router** (Navigation between pages)
- **Material UI** (Switches, dropdowns, and layout components)
